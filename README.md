# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Louise Smith had a recent Kickstarter project for her play Fever reach its goal very quickly, and she tasked me with an analysis of a large dataset of Kickstarter projects - comparing how they fared and mining the dataset for potential correlations to assist in her plans for future Kickstarter initiatives.

### Purpose

In this analysis, we will be focusing in on the Theater and Plays category and subcategory, respectively, and how different variables may or may not affect a successful Kickstarter within this topic.  Two of the most important variables for setting up a Kickstarter are when (what year, which part of the year, etc.) and the Goal to complete the Kickstarter.

#### Plausible Queries

- Does starting the Kickstarter at a particular time of year make it more likely to succeed?
- Does having a small goal or a large goal make it more likely for the Kickstarter to succeed?

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

#### Figure 1

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results
Two conclusions are made about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date (2 pt).
One conclusion is made about the Outcomes based on Goals (2 pt).
There is a summary of the limitations of the dataset, and there is a recommendation for additional tables or graphs (2 pt).

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
